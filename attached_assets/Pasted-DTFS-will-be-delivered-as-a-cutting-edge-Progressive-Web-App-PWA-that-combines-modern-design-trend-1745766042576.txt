DTFS will be delivered as a cutting-edge Progressive Web App (PWA) that combines modern design trends, robust front-end frameworks, and best practices for performance, accessibility, and offline capability. We’ll use React (or Next.js) with Tailwind CSS, Material Design components, and Workbox for service-worker support. The UI will embrace asymmetrical, micro-animated layouts with bold typography and expressive colors, while ensuring a mobile-first, multilingual experience powered by i18next. Core modules—Trade Finance, Marketplace, Training, Wallet, and Ava AI—will be developed as modular, lazy-loaded components. We’ll simulate PAPSS payments and PADC stablecoin transactions, integrate live user-testing hooks, and expose feedback channels. Below is a detailed developer prompt to implement this vision.

1. Project Overview
Create DTFS PWA with the following goals:

Instant Trade Finance: Smart-contract simulation for invoice financing.

Integrated Marketplace: B2B/B2C listings with AI-driven search and filters.

Import/Export Training: Interactive, certified learning modules.

Ava AI Assistant: Floating multilingual chatbot widget.

Wallet & Payments: Simulated PADC stablecoin and “Pay with PAPSS” flows.

2. Tech Stack & Tooling
Framework: Next.js with create-next-pwa CLI for zero-config PWA setup

.

Navigation: Experimental sidebar that collapses to a gesture-driven bottom tab on mobile

.

Badges & Trust Indicators: “Certified Export-Ready Business”, “Trade Finance Approved” displayed on profiles and listings.

Training Modules: Card carousels with progress bars and “Earn Certification” badges.

Ava AI Widget: Floating chat bubble that expands into a conversational UI built with React Chat UI.

Responsive Modes: Use tailwindcss-displaymodes to adjust visibility and layout per device

4. Feature Modules & Implementation
4.1 Trade Finance
Upload invoice → simulate smart-contract approval → show “Smart Contract Receipt.”

Use lazy loading and API mocking for instant feedback.

4.2 Marketplace
Product listing cards with filter by category, country, price.

AI search suggestions (typeahead) using Fuse.js.

“Request Trade Financing” triggers finance modal.

4.3 Training
Interactive lessons (video/text), quiz components, progress saved in IndexedDB for offline.

Certification badge issuance via JSON-based credentials.

4.4 Wallet & Payments
Show balances for PADC, DTFS, USDT (simulated).

“Pay with PAPSS” button opens a modal with country/currency selector.

Offline-first transaction queue with Workbox background sync.

4.5 Ava AI Assistant
Chat UI powered by OpenAI API (or mock responses) with language detection.

Commands: “How do I list a product?”, “Explain customs docs”.

5. Performance & SEO
Lighthouse Score: Aim ≥90 in Performance, PWA, Accessibility 
web.dev
.

Image Optimization: Use Next.js next/image with lazy loading.

Code Splitting: Dynamic imports per module for faster initial load.

Critical CSS: Extract and inline above-the-fold styles.

6. Live User Testing
Integrate Hotjar/Clarity on all routes to capture heatmaps.

Floating “Give Feedback” button linking to Typeform embed.

Set up a “Demo Mode” overlay that lets testers simulate features without real transactions.

7. Deployment & CI/CD
Host on Vercel or Netlify for global CDN, HTTPS, and PWA support.

Use GitHub Actions:

Lint (ESLint), Type-check (TypeScript), Test (Jest + React Testing Library).

Build & deploy on push to main.
